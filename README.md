    * logistic regression
    * random forset
    * naive bayes
    * support vector classifier

 ## preprocessing 
 - preprocess the data by removing stop words, punctuations and remove tashkeel

 - using `label encoder` to encode the target

 ## models
 ### TF-IDF Vectorization
 The first step is to convert text into numerical features. One of the most popular techniques used in natural language processing is tfidf

 ### Logistic regression
 one of the most pouplar classification model in machine learning and got accuracy 85% 

 ### Random forset
 another popular algorithm used as a base line. It has an average accurcy score around 81% 

 ### naive bayes    
it gots accuracy 80%        


### support vector classifier
it also gets good results with high accuaracy at about  85%.


## Recommenation 
* We can use both Naive Bayes Classifier (NB) & Support Vector Machine

* we can also use RNN for getting better results.
